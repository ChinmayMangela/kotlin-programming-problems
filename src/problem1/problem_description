Problem 1: Data Class Creation & Basic Manipulation

You'll be dealing with JSON data that Retrofit converts into Kotlin objects (data classes).

Task: Define a data class named User with the following properties: id (Int), name (String), email (String).

Task: Create two instances of the User data class.

Task: Print the name and email of both users.

Task: Create a copy of one user, changing only their email address, and print the new user's details.
