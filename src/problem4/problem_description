Problem 4: Handling Nested Data (More Realistic API)

APIs often return nested JSON structures. Retrofit will map these to nested data classes.

Task: Define two data classes:

Address: street (String), city (String), zipCode (String).

Company: name (String), catchPhrase (String).

UserWithAddress: id (Int), name (String), email (String), address (Address), company (Company, nullable).

Task: Create two UserWithAddress instances, one where company is null and one where company is defined.

Task: For each user, print their name, city, and if company is not null, print the company's name. Use safe calls (?.) and the Elvis operator (?:) where appropriate.
